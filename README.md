# Australian Grapevine Varieties

Grapevine Varieties as curated by Wine Australia https://www.wineaustralia.com/getmedia/5c28183c-9340-4e31-9924-42d97cdc1fae/Australian-OIV-List-012017.pdf

Full list of data with Prime Name and Synonyms as in the pdf above listed in this file: https://github.com/collabriculture/australian-grape-vine-varieties/blob/main/data/full-list-wine-australia

This list has been created in github to make it easier for application developers to add, manage, and display the list. 

We invite changes and ideas in how to make this list more meaningful for users, such as dividing into white/red/region, identifying prioritisation, or other ideas.

## Thinking about data sorting 

Creating a manageable way to sort, store, and expose search filters for users is a key next step consideration. 

Maintainability and practicality is a core concern.
